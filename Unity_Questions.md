1. What is Prefab?
Asset type that allows you to store a GameObject object complete with components and properties. The prefab acts as a template from which you can create new object instances in the scene. Any edits made to a prefab asset are immediately reflected in all instances produced from it but you can also override components and settings for each instance individually.

2. What is Nested Prefab?
instances inside other Prefabs. This is called nesting Prefabs. Nested Prefabs retain their links to their own Prefab Assets, while also forming part of another Prefab Asset.
