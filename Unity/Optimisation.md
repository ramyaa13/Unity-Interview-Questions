## SCRIPTABLE OBJECTS

A ScriptableObject is a data container that you can use to save large amounts of data, independent of class instances. 
One of the main use cases for ScriptableObjects is to reduce your Projectâ€™s memory usage by avoiding copies of values. 
This is useful if your Project has a Prefab that stores unchanging data in attached MonoBehaviour scripts .
Every time you instantiate that Prefab, it will get its own copy of that data. 
Instead of using the method, and storing duplicated data, you can use a ScriptableObject to store the data and then access it by reference from all of the Prefabs. 
This means that there is one copy of the data in memory.

## ASSET BUNDLES

An AssetBundle is an archive file that contains platform-specific non-code Assets (such as Models, Textures, Prefabs, Audio clips, and even entire Scenes) that Unity can load at run time. 
AssetBundle archive. The AssetBundle archive is a container, like a folder, that holds additional files inside it. These additional files consist of two types:

**serialized file** - which contains your Assets broken out into their individual objects and written out to this single file.
**Resource files** -  which are chunks of binary data stored separately for certain Assets (Textures and audio) to allow Unity to efficiently load them from disk on another thread.
